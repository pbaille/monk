** =nil= and =false=
The old question of =false=
Should it be considered truthy?
Booleans are valuable data that should be decoupled from control flow ?
For now false is not allowed and short-circuits the execution.
This was originally intended to ease clojure integration but do not seems to still be necessary.
The wrapping of clojure predicates into guards now occurs in =monk.core=.
*** first try
created =false-is-a-value= branch


** =[:use monk.core]=
Currently monk is intended to be 'used'.
It is not a common practice in the clojure community for good reasons.
It conflicts with many tools and is not clojurescript friendly.
